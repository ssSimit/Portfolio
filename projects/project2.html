      <p class="project-intro">
        A fast-paced puzzle game where players shoot colored shapes to match and destroy chains of shapes moving along a
        circular path. The core idea was to combine classic chain-matching mechanics with strategic power-ups, creating
        an engaging and visually dynamic experience.

        <h3>About the Project</h3>
        <p>
          Shape Explorer is a puzzle game developed for Chimpvine (Danson Solution Pvt. Ltd.), available on both the
          company website and the Google Play Store. The gameplay revolves around chains of moving shapes that advance
          toward the center of a circular arena. Players must shoot shapes of corresponding colors to match three or
          more, causing them to be destroyed and shortening the chain. Strategic elements include bombs, which, when
          triggered by nearby matches, destroy large portions of the chain for satisfying, high-impact gameplay.

          The goal of the project was to create a visually engaging, addictive puzzle experience that tests timing,
          strategy, and pattern recognition. Attention was given to smooth chain movement, responsive shooting
          mechanics, and satisfying visual and audio feedback to enhance player engagement. Multiplayer-friendly
          features and progression tracking were also considered to extend replayability.

          For the Google Play Store version, I implemented Google Play Games authentication and integrated Firebase to
          store and retrieve high scores, providing a connected and persistent experience for players.
