      <h2>Banana Barrage</h2>

      <p class="project-intro">
An educational game designed to teach the concept of place value (ones, tens, and hundreds) through a playful, competitive shooting mechanic. The core idea was to connect numerical understanding with an engaging, skill-based gameplay loop.      </p>

        <h3>About the Project</h3>
        <p>
            Banana Barrage is an educational game developed for Chimpvine (Danson Solution Pvt. Ltd.), available on the company website. It introduces players to place value concepts by embedding learning within an interactive and competitive experience. Players aim and shoot banana peels into a dustbin to earn points, with accuracy and timing directly affecting their score. Rather than teaching place values in isolation, the game uses the score accumulated during gameplay as the foundation for explaining how numbers are formed using ones, tens, and hundreds.

After each gameplay session, the acquired score is used to assess the player’s understanding of place value, allowing learners to see how their actions translate into numerical representation. This approach helps bridge the gap between abstract math concepts and concrete in-game outcomes.

To increase engagement and difficulty, the game features a CPU-controlled opponent that competes with the player by aiming and shooting banana peels toward the same target. When both players shoot simultaneously, collisions can occur, causing missed shots or loss of points. This introduces strategic decision-making and timing, especially at higher difficulty levels, while keeping the core learning objective intact.

Overall, the experience was designed to be fun, competitive, and educational, encouraging repeated play while reinforcing foundational math skills.
